# Calculator App

This is a React-Typescript app created for the take-home assignment for Vial Health.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app on your browser

## Added Features
- The calculator should have a browser-based user interface (ie it can be opened using a web browser)
- The calculator should have a number pad with digits 0-9 and decimal point.
- The calculator should have buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The calculator should have a display that shows the input and the result of the calculation.
- The calculator should follow the order of operations (PEMDAS).
- Percentage function (%)
- History function
- Better UI

## Notes

There is a strange bug that crops up with the display in Chrome, specifically
when your input the minus sign. I could not reproduce this bug on any other
browser, leading me to believe that it is an issue with Chrome.
